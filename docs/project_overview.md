# **Edge AI with Federated Learning using Syft and TensorFlow**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to build a decentralized federated learning system using **Syft** and **TensorFlow**. Federated learning allows for distributed training on multiple client nodes, where each node trains the model locally without the need to share the raw data. The central server coordinates this process, aggregating the locally trained models into a global model. The project focuses on preserving user privacy, data confidentiality, and enhancing scalability in AI systems by leveraging federated learning across different devices.

## **Key Features**

- **Federated Learning**: Implemented using **PySyft**, enabling distributed training across client nodes.
- **TensorFlow Integration**: The models are built and trained using **TensorFlow** to ensure compatibility with state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks.
- **Data Privacy**: Raw data never leaves the client node, adhering to privacy-preserving principles.
- **Decentralization**: No need for a centralized data repository; training happens locally, while only the model updates are shared.
- **Syft**: PySyft provides tools for secure and private AI, especially for federated learning, by abstracting the complexities of client-server interactions.

## **Objectives**

The primary objective of this project is to build an **Edge AI system** that leverages federated learning to train models across decentralized client nodes without sharing private user data. The project will focus on:

1. **Privacy-preserving AI**: Ensure that models can be trained without exposing sensitive data to third parties.
2. **Decentralized Learning**: Enable learning from multiple decentralized nodes, improving model generalization across different environments.
3. **Efficient Communication**: Reduce communication overhead between the client nodes and the server to make the federated learning process more scalable.
4. **Secure Aggregation**: Implement secure model aggregation strategies (e.g., **FedAvg**) to combine local models on the server without accessing local data.
5. **Adaptability**: The solution will be adaptable to various datasets and machine learning problems, including computer vision and NLP tasks.
6. **Scalability**: Support for scaling up to a large number of client nodes without degradation in performance.
7. **TensorFlow & Syft Integration**: Utilize TensorFlow’s power for model training and Syft’s capabilities for decentralized, privacy-preserving learning.

## **Scope of the Project**

The scope of the project includes setting up a complete federated learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, and will cover the following components:

### **1. Data Management**
   - **Preprocessing**: Efficient data loading, cleaning, and formatting across decentralized nodes.
   - **FEMNIST Dataset**: The project uses the **FEMNIST dataset**, a variant of the MNIST dataset, for image classification in a federated setting.

### **2. Federated Learning Setup**
   - **Client Nodes**: Each client node runs a local training script that utilizes **TensorFlow** for model training and **Syft** for federated communication.
   - **Server Node**: The central server manages the aggregation of model updates from each client node and computes the global model using the **FedAvg** algorithm.

### **3. Syft & TensorFlow Integration**
   - **TensorFlow Models**: Build machine learning models (CNN and LSTM) using **TensorFlow**.
   - **PySyft**: Integrate **PySyft** to securely handle federated communication, ensuring model updates (parameters) are securely transmitted to the central server.
   - **Federated Model Training**: Implement federated training loops where client nodes send model updates to the central server for aggregation.

### **4. Model Training**
   - **Local Training**: Each client node trains the model on local data using **TensorFlow**.
   - **Federated Training**: Model updates from the local nodes are securely aggregated on the central server.
   - **Model Aggregation**: Use the **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)** algorithm for aggregation of model updates.
   - **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use configuration files for tuning hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, number of client nodes, etc.

### **5. Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the global model on a test dataset after aggregation.
   - Use custom metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess model performance.
   - Visualize training progress with accuracy and loss plots using **Matplotlib**.

### **6. Deployment & Monitoring**
   - **Docker**: Containerize the client and server nodes for easy deployment in any environment (e.g., cloud or edge devices).
   - **Docker-Compose**: Use **docker-compose** for multi-container orchestration, managing both the client and server containers.
   - **Monitoring**: Use structured logging and monitoring tools to ensure proper orchestration of the nodes and efficient resource utilization during training.

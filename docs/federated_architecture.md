# **Federated Learning Architecture with Syft and TensorFlow**

## **Introduction**

This document provides a detailed overview of the **federated learning architecture** for our project, which leverages **PySyft** and **TensorFlow**. The primary goal of this architecture is to enable decentralized, privacy-preserving machine learning where data remains on the client devices, and only model updates are shared with a central server.

### **Key Components:**
- **Client Nodes**: Local devices where data resides and models are trained.
- **Server Node**: Central server responsible for aggregating model updates from clients and coordinating federated training.
- **Federated Learning Process**: Decentralized learning where local updates from client nodes are aggregated into a global model.
- **PySyft Integration**: Utilized for secure communication between client nodes and the server, enabling privacy-preserving federated learning.

## **Federated Learning Setup**

### **Overview**

Federated Learning is a machine learning technique that allows model training across decentralized devices (or client nodes) without requiring raw data to leave the client. The central server only receives model updates (e.g., weights and gradients) from the clients, not the actual data, ensuring data privacy.

---

### **Federated Learning Workflow**

1. **Initialization**:
   - The server node initializes the global model and shares the initial model parameters with all client nodes.
   
2. **Client-Side Local Training**:
   - Each client node trains a local model on its own dataset using TensorFlow.
   - The local training does not require data to be shared outside the device. Instead, each node computes local model updates (gradients).
   
3. **Model Updates**:
   - After training, the client nodes send their local model updates (e.g., weights or gradients) to the central server.
   - To preserve privacy, this communication happens securely through **PySyft**.

4. **Federated Aggregation**:
   - The server node collects all local updates and aggregates them using the **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)** algorithm.
   - The server updates the global model using the aggregated updates and redistributes the updated model to the client nodes.

5. **Iterations**:
   - This process is repeated across several communication rounds until the global model reaches convergence.

## **Federated Learning Architecture**

The architecture of this federated learning system is designed to ensure that training can happen locally on client nodes while maintaining privacy and security using **PySyft**.

### **1. Client Nodes**

Each **client node** (edge device) performs local model training using its own data, which is never shared with the server or other nodes. The key components of the client node are:

- **Local Dataset**: Private data stored on the client node.
- **Local Model Training**: A local copy of the model is trained using **TensorFlow** on the client’s data.
- **Communication with the Server**: Once the local model is trained, the client uses **PySyft** to securely send the model updates to the central server.

**Client-Side Workflow**:

1. Download the initial model parameters from the server.
2. Train the model locally using TensorFlow.
3. Compute gradients or weights from the local training.
4. Send the local model updates to the server using **PySyft**.

```bash
├── federated_system/
│   ├── client_node.py                      # Script for client-side federated learning
```

### **2. Server Node**

The **server node** coordinates the federated learning process, handles model aggregation, and communicates with all client nodes. The central server:

- **Initializes the Global Model**: The server initializes the model and distributes it to client nodes.
- **Aggregates Local Updates**: After receiving local model updates from client nodes, the server aggregates them using the **FedAvg** algorithm.
- **Updates and Redistributes the Global Model**: After aggregation, the global model is updated and redistributed to all client nodes for the next round of training.

**Server-Side Workflow**:

1. Initialize and distribute the global model to all clients.
2. Receive local model updates from the clients.
3. Aggregate the updates using **FedAvg** or other aggregation strategies.
4. Update the global model and send it back to clients for the next round.

```bash
├── federated_system/
│   ├── server_node.py                      # Script for server-side model aggregation
```

### **3. PySyft Integration**

**PySyft** provides the necessary tools to handle secure, decentralized machine learning. It enables:

- **Model Sharing**: The server can distribute model parameters to clients securely.
- **Privacy Preservation**: By ensuring that only model updates (weights or gradients) are shared, and not the raw data.
- **Encryption**: Model updates sent between client nodes and the server can be encrypted to prevent third-party access.

Key **PySyft** functionality includes:
- **Federated Tensors**: Tensors are split across client nodes, keeping data local.
- **Federated Learning Hooks**: TensorFlow models are connected with PySyft hooks for federated learning.

**Example PySyft Code for Federated Training**:

```python
import syft as sy
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize a hook for TensorFlow with Syft
hook = sy.TFHook(tf)

# Define model training on the client side
def client_training():
    # Initialize model
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    # Train model locally on client data
    model.fit(client_data, client_labels, epochs=5)
    
    # Send model updates to server using PySyft
    model.send(server)
```

**Aggregation on the Server Side**:

```python
def federated_averaging(global_model, client_models):
    # Aggregate model weights using FedAvg
    new_weights = np.mean([client.get().weights for client in client_models], axis=0)
    global_model.set_weights(new_weights)
    return global_model
```

```bash
├── federated_system/
│   ├── federated_manager.py                # Manages communication between server and clients
│   ├── aggregation.py                      # Contains logic for FedAvg and other aggregation methods
```

## **Federated Aggregation with FedAvg**

One of the key components of federated learning is the aggregation of model updates. In our system, we implement **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)** as the default aggregation algorithm.

**FedAvg Algorithm**:
1. Each client trains its model locally on a subset of the data.
2. The server collects the updated model weights from each client.
3. The server computes the weighted average of the model updates (weights), where each client’s contribution is proportional to the number of local data samples.
4. The updated global model is sent back to the clients.

## **Configuration and Parameters**

The configuration of the federated learning system, including the number of clients, rounds of communication, and learning rate, is managed through the **federated_config.yaml** file.

```yaml
# federated_config.yaml

server:
  address: "localhost"
  port: 8000
  rounds: 5

clients:
  count: 10
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.001
  epochs: 5

aggregation:
  strategy: "FedAvg"
```

## **Deployment Setup**

The federated learning system can be deployed on both local machines or in a cloud environment using **Docker** and **Docker-Compose**. The deployment includes:
- **Server Node** running the model aggregation logic.
- **Client Nodes** running local training tasks.

## **Conclusion**

This federated learning architecture ensures that data privacy is preserved while enabling the creation of a global model through decentralized training. Using **PySyft** and **TensorFlow**, the system can securely train models across multiple client nodes and aggregate updates without sharing sensitive data. The flexibility of this setup allows it to be adapted for various use cases, including healthcare, IoT, and any environment where data privacy is critical.

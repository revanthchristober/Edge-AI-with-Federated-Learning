# **Evaluation Strategy for Federated Learning System**

## **Introduction**

This document explains the evaluation strategy employed in our **federated learning system** using **TensorFlow** and **PySyft**. The evaluation focuses on performance tracking, model accuracy, loss, and custom metrics such as **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**. Additionally, the process for **tracking metrics** across federated training rounds is described, ensuring that the federated system is robust and well-monitored.

### **Key Metrics:**
1. **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model’s predictions.
2. **Loss**: Reflects how well the model is optimizing its learning objective.
3. **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of the positive predictions.
4. **Recall**: Measures the model’s ability to capture all relevant positive instances.
5. **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric for classification performance.

## **1. Metrics for Evaluation**

### **1.1 Accuracy**

**Accuracy** is the most common metric used to evaluate the overall performance of the model. It measures the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.

**Formula**:
\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}}
\]

**TensorFlow Implementation**:

```python
def evaluate_accuracy(model, test_data, test_labels):
    """Evaluates the accuracy of the model."""
    loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
    return accuracy
```

In federated learning, the accuracy can be computed locally on each client and then aggregated on the server.

### **1.2 Loss**

**Loss** is another important metric that measures how well the model is performing with respect to its optimization objective. For classification problems, the **cross-entropy loss** is commonly used.

**TensorFlow Implementation**:

```python
def evaluate_loss(model, test_data, test_labels):
    """Evaluates the loss of the model."""
    loss, _ = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
    print(f"Test Loss: {loss:.4f}")
    return loss
```

## **2. Custom Classification Metrics**

In addition to accuracy and loss, more granular performance metrics are used to evaluate the quality of the model’s predictions.

### **2.1 Precision**

**Precision** measures how accurate the positive predictions are. A high precision means that when the model predicts a positive class, it’s usually correct.

**Formula**:
\[
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
\]

**TensorFlow Implementation**:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score

def evaluate_precision(model, test_data, test_labels):
    """Evaluates the precision of the model's predictions."""
    predictions = model.predict(test_data)
    predicted_classes = tf.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
    precision = precision_score(test_labels, predicted_classes, average='weighted')
    print(f"Precision: {precision:.4f}")
    return precision
```

### **2.2 Recall**

**Recall** measures how well the model captures all relevant positive instances.

**Formula**:
\[
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
\]

**TensorFlow Implementation**:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

def evaluate_recall(model, test_data, test_labels):
    """Evaluates the recall of the model's predictions."""
    predictions = model.predict(test_data)
    predicted_classes = tf.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
    recall = recall_score(test_labels, predicted_classes, average='weighted')
    print(f"Recall: {recall:.4f}")
    return recall
```

### **2.3 F1-Score**

The **F1-score** is the harmonic mean of **precision** and **recall**. It provides a balanced measure of a model's performance, particularly when dealing with imbalanced classes.

**Formula**:
\[
\text{F1} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\]

**TensorFlow Implementation**:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

def evaluate_f1_score(model, test_data, test_labels):
    """Evaluates the F1-score of the model's predictions."""
    predictions = model.predict(test_data)
    predicted_classes = tf.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
    f1 = f1_score(test_labels, predicted_classes, average='weighted')
    print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
    return f1
```

## **3. Federated Learning Evaluation**

In federated learning, each client node trains locally on its dataset, and after several rounds, the local models are aggregated on the central server. Evaluation is typically performed on the global model after aggregation or locally on client nodes.

### **3.1 Local Evaluation on Client Nodes**

After each federated learning round, client nodes can evaluate their local models on test data.

```python
def local_evaluation(client_model, test_data, test_labels):
    """Performs local evaluation on client nodes."""
    accuracy = evaluate_accuracy(client_model, test_data, test_labels)
    loss = evaluate_loss(client_model, test_data, test_labels)
    return accuracy, loss
```

### **3.2 Global Evaluation on the Server Node**

Once the local models are aggregated using a strategy like **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**, the global model can be evaluated on the test data of the central server.

```python
def global_evaluation(global_model, global_test_data, global_test_labels):
    """Evaluates the global model on test data after aggregation."""
    accuracy = evaluate_accuracy(global_model, global_test_data, global_test_labels)
    loss = evaluate_loss(global_model, global_test_data, global_test_labels)
    return accuracy, loss
```

## **4. Performance Tracking Across Federated Rounds**

It is essential to track the performance of the model over multiple rounds of federated learning. This helps understand whether the aggregation process improves global model performance.

### **4.1 Logging Federated Metrics**

Each round, the server logs the performance metrics (accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1-score) for the global model and tracks how it evolves over time.

```python
class FederatedLogger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {'accuracy': [], 'loss': [], 'precision': [], 'recall': [], 'f1': []}

    def log_metrics(self, accuracy, loss, precision, recall, f1):
        """Logs the metrics for the federated round."""
        self.metrics['accuracy'].append(accuracy)
        self.metrics['loss'].append(loss)
        self.metrics['precision'].append(precision)
        self.metrics['recall'].append(recall)
        self.metrics['f1'].append(f1)
        print(f"Logged metrics for round: Accuracy={accuracy:.4f}, Loss={loss:.4f}")

# Example Usage
federated_logger = FederatedLogger()
federated_logger.log_metrics(accuracy, loss, precision, recall, f1)
```

### **4.2 Visualizing Federated Performance**

You can visualize the performance over multiple rounds using a plotting library like **Matplotlib**. This provides a clear view of how well the global model is performing after each round of training and aggregation.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_federated_performance(logger):
    """Plots the federated performance metrics over rounds."""
    rounds = range(1, len(logger.metrics['accuracy']) + 1)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

    # Accuracy Plot
    plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
    plt.plot(rounds, logger.metrics['accuracy'], marker='o')
    plt.title('Accuracy over Federated Rounds')
    plt.xlabel('Round')
    plt.ylabel('Accuracy')

    # Loss Plot
    plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
    plt.plot(rounds, logger.metrics['loss'], marker='o', color='r')
    plt.title('Loss over Federated Rounds')
    plt.xlabel('Round')
    plt.ylabel('Loss')

    # Precision Plot
    plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
    plt.plot(rounds, logger.metrics['precision'], marker='o', color='g')
    plt.title('Precision over Federated Rounds')
    plt.xlabel('Round')
    plt.ylabel('Precision')

    # F1 Score Plot
    plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
    plt.plot(rounds, logger.metrics['f1'], marker='o', color='b')
    plt.title('F1 Score over Federated Rounds')
    plt.xlabel('Round')
    plt.ylabel('F1 Score')

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```
